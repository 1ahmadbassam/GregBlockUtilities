# GregBlockUtilities
 An addon for GregTech CE and Ex Nihilo, made specifically for the mod pack GregBlock

This fork incorporates the fixes https://github.com/TheLimePixel/GregBlockUtilities/pull/3 and https://github.com/TheLimePixel/GregBlockUtilities/pull/12.

This fork actually incorporates fixes to make it buildable, make sure to use an old-ish JDK 8 version (use ```-Dorg.gradle.java.home=``` Gradle param), update the CT2 version as necessary in the ```gradle.properties``` file, and provide the libraries in the libs directory.

Libraries (could be copied from latest version of Gregblock):
```
BetterQuesting-3.5.287.jar
GregicAdditions-1.12.2-1.4.3.jar
gregtech-1.12.2-1.7.0.387.jar
```

Check the releases tab for a precompiled binary.
