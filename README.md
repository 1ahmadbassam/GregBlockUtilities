# GregBlockUtilities
 An addon for GregTech CE and Ex Nihilo, made specifically for the mod pack GregBlock

## The Fork
This fork is made exclusively to make an unofficial update to GregBlock to support the currently newest GregTech Community Edition (1.8.0)
The fork was created for the Modded Minecraft Club at: https://www.moddedminecraft.club/

## The Fork (2)
This fork was made based on the work to modernize from GTCE 1.8 / 1.11.3 to latest 1.17, as well as fixing a major bug that existed in the original release.
Libs required:
```
BetterQuesting-3.5.329.jar
binnie-mods-1.12.2-2.5.1.211.jar (modified Binnie's mods)
GregicAdditions-1.12.2-1.4.14.jar (custom version, can be found with my repos. Modernized to 1.17 as well)
gregtech-1.12.2-1.17.1.770.jar
```

Note: I have modified ```gradlew.bat``` to point to Java 8 on my system since my Java home is 17. If you want to build this, make sure to change that to the directory of Java 8 on your machine.
